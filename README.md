SMS Plus for Atari Falcon
==========================

Here's a quick port of SMS plus (based on my own TI-Nspire port) for the Atari Falcon 030.

This works on EmuTOS/TOS 4.04 with only 4MB of memory. However, it is very slow !

Don't expect it to run very fast, unless of course you own a CT60/CT63, in which case it might run at a decent speed.

Input doesn't work properly, i haven't bothered with it. maybe i'll fix it later

You can exit the emulator by pressing the Space bar.

This works best on VGA/RGB and the emulator uses a resolution of 160x144 (True color) for Game gear games,and 256x192 for Master system games.

Since true color is slow on the falcon, i would advise to stick with the GG versions if possible.

Of course, this was ported by me, because no one cares about the Atari Falcon.

Special thanks to Orion for his devkit though.


You can also use the command line to start your own SMS or GG rom.

If no files are specified, by default, it looks for test.gg.
